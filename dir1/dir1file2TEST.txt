s Struggle
	During the mid 19th century through the early 20th century, the United States of America underwent enormous changes in both technological and industrial development. Years after the American Civil War that united our nation, America was still seen as the land of opportunity for many across the Atlantic and even held the title of    the    s most powerful industrial     (Rosenzweig and Lichtenstein, 23). Although the industrial north and the agricultural south would remain fairly divided for years to come, they would share the common difficulty with labor. In both cases, the growing industry prompted more work, which in return brought more people to America than ever before. Unfortunately for the working class, every mountain has its peak. The elevation of capitalism and industrial labor would soon tremble in a long downhill spiral ending in an economic depression. This would lead to harsh, unfair work environments with little job opportunities, prompting the working class into joining unions and labor forces in order to fight back for fair rights and survive.
	A short period after the Civil War, a select few began to exploit the newly formed America and set up companies in giant industries. People such as Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, and Alexander Graham Bell    s impacts during this time period are still felt today. These people quickly set up their individual empires, which include    Andrew Carnegie build[ing] his first steel plant, John D. Rockefeller organiz[ing] Standard oil, and Alexander Graham Bell manufactur[ing]     (Rosenzweig and Lichtenstein, 27). As these businesses quickly rose their way into enormous enterprises, a large impact on the market occurred since no industrial change this vast has happened this quickly in America before. These companies alone would offer thousands of jobs to the working class over the coming years, and this had a direct effect on the large amounts of immigrants coming to America. Regardless of how much labor Carnegie, Rockefeller, and    s companies induced, nothing compared to the labor had on      laying    125,000 miles of track that would be laid in the next twenty-five years giv[ing] the United States the most extensive transportation system in the world, promoting economic development across the     (Rosenzweig and Lichtenstein, 28-29). The economy, already unstable, was vastly shaken with this project due to the impact a railroad system had on small and large businesses alike, heeding both with exponentially more competition than they had before. As a result, what was meant to be a large    economic     directly led into a five-year economic depression, and the fight to survive for the working class began.
